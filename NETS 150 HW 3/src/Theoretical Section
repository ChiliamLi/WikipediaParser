Theoretical Section: 

1. URI= uniform resource identifier. URL= uniform resource locator. Every URL is a URI. So URI is the more general name for URL in this case. 
Our URL also tells us the way in which we will access the location. 

Differences: 1) in java, URI class has a constructor to specify all parts of the syntax
             2) you can create a new instance of URI using a method, whereas you can't using URL. 
             
2. A MalformedURLException is thrown when this happens!

3. getRedirectURL() {
try 
{ 
    httpConnection.setInstanceFollowRedirects(false); 
    if (httpConnection.getResponseCode() >= 300 && < 400) {
        return URL(httpConnection.getHeaderField("Location"); 
    }
}
    catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace(); 
    }
    return null; 
}
ASSUMPTION: Assumption that we don't need to catch errors, because it will automatically direct for us with catch:
